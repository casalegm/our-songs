      <h1>Body Like a Back Road</h1>
      <h2>Sam Hunt</h2>
        <p>Got a girl from the south side, got braids in her hair<br>
          First time I seen her walk by, man I 'bout fell off my chair<br>
          Had to get her number, it took me like six weeks<br>
          Now me and her go way back like Cadillac seats<br></p>
        <p>Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed<br>
          I know every curve like the back of my hand<br>
          Doin' 15 in a 30, I ain't in no hurry<br>
          I'mma take it slow just as fast as I can<br></p>
        <p>The way she fit in them blue jeans, she don't need no belt<br>
          But I can turn them inside out, I don't need no help<br>
          Got hips like honey, so thick and so sweet<br>
          It ain't no curves like hers on them downtown streets<br></p>
        <p>Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed<br>
          I know every curve like the back of my hand<br>
          Doin' 15 in a 30, I ain't in no hurry<br>
          I'mma take it slow just as fast as I can<br></p>
        <p>We're out here in the boondocks<br>
          With the breeze and the birds<br>
          Tangled up in the tall grass<br>
          With my lips on hers<br>
          On the highway to heaven<br>
          Headed south of her smile<br>
          Get there when we get there<br>
          Every inch is a mile<br></p>
        <p>Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed<br>
          I know every curve like the back of my hand<br>
          Doin' 15 in a 30, I ain't in no hurry<br>
          I'mma take it slow just as fast as I can<br></p>
        <p>I'mma take it slow<br>
          Just as fast as I can<br>
          (Body like a back road)<br>
          (Drivin' with my eyes closed) Got braids in her hair<br>
          (I know every curve like the back of my hand)<br></p>
